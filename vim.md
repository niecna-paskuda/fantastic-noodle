## Python

There are a couple of plugins around, of course, which facilitate developing python in vim.

### Syntax, linters, checkers

Using a plugin to automatically fire tools and display errors inside the editor \(e.g. on writing a file and display errors in the gutter/separate window\):

* [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic): can be used with [multiple checkers](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic/tree/master/syntax_checkers/python). Synchronous. 

  ‚ùì Is syntastic as slow as it is with [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) when large files are parsed?

* [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale): can be used with [multiple checkers](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/blob/master/supported-tools.md) \(see Python\). Asynchronous.
* [vim-flake8](https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8): fires up the Flake8 executable in currently open file. Not as flexible as the more generic syntastic and ale.

Using a plugin to delegate the checking to a separate tmux/terminal pane. Among others [vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux) could be considered.
